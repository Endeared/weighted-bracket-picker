weighted-bracket-picker
=======================

A March Madness bracket picker using weighted statistics


To Do List
==========
* Transform every statistic into a 0 - 100 range across teams.  Keep track of a multiplier and linear offset per stat.
* Create actual bracket. Need to calculate first-four matchups before loading into jquery-bracket library. Iterate 1-8 per region, using 16-9 as the opponents.
* Make random parameter get generated on submit() call rather than on page load.
